# Anomaly Detection Project (UCL)
---

## 📌 Overview

Generative AI technologies can be maliciously used for misinformation, making detection tools crucial to keep up with the rapid evolution of synthetic content. This project frames the detection of fake audio as an **anomaly detection problem**. By leveraging **Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) modeling** and **interpretable machine learning**, the goal is to develop a robust pipeline for identifying synthetic audio in time series data.

## Week 1: Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)

### What are SDEs?

A **Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)** is like an ordinary differential equation (ODE) 
but with an additional noise term that models stochastic (random) fluctuations.

The computational definition of an SDE with Gaussian noise is:

where ξ is a normally distributed random variable with zero mean and unit variance. 
The value of X(t + Δt) is computed from X(t), and this process is repeated for each time step.

Formally, an SDE can be written as:

- f(Xₜ, t) — drift term (deterministic trend)  
- g(Xₜ, t) — diffusion term (magnitude of stochastic effects)  
- Wₜ — Wiener process (Brownian motion)  
- dWₜ — infinitesimal random increment with mean 0 and variance dt

An **SDE realisation** is a single sample path generated by solving the SDE numerically, 
typically using methods like **Euler–Maruyama**. Each realisation reflects a possible evolution of 
the process over time.

## Week 2: Anomaly Detection For SDEs
### Overview
Design an algorithm that can classify sample paths (realisations) from these three different SDEs.

### Data
- **Corpus:** 10,000 SDE 1 realisations  
- **Validation:** 2,000 SDE 1, 1,000 SDE 2, 1,000 SDE 3  
- **Test:** Same as validation, shuffled  

### Approach

1. **Visual Exploration**  
   - Plotted realisations of the three SDEs and explored feature distributions (scatter plots, histograms) to identify separations.  
   - Example of SDE realisations:  
     <img width="1000" height="600" alt="Figure_1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/725e59f8-70d7-474d-94ce-d2e920fe4471" />
     
   - Explored features to see which gave greatest separation between SDEs.

2. **Observations**  
   - **SDE 2:** highest noise → largest standard deviation of increments  
   - **SDE 1:** intermediate standard deviation of increments
   - **SDE 3:** filtered → smallest standard deviation of increments  
   - Clear separation observed between **SDE 1 and SDE 2**, partial overlap between **SDE 1 and SDE 3**

3. **Classification**  
   - Manually chose thresholds based on observed standard deviations.  
   - Applied thresholds to classify each path.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Increasing the number of timestamps → greater accuracy  
   - Increasing sample size → less deviation in accuracy (closer to real accuracy)  

   - Additional feature analysis could further improve the algorithm.
